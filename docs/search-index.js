The file is used to specify options such as the generator to use, additional compilation options, and filters. Here’s an example of a configuration file: source-root: ../include multipage: false generate: adoc The Usage page provides a detailed explanation of what to combine options from the configuration file and the command line. The Reference section provides a detailed explanation of the options available. A number of options can be used to specify with which compile options MrDocs should be run. source-root: .. compilation-database: ../CMakeLists.txt cmake: '-D MRDOCS_BUILD=ON' defines: 'MRDOCS_BUILD' The compile options primarily come from the compilation-database file. When this file is generated from a CMakeLists.txt script, the cmake option can be used to specify additional options to pass to CMake. Additionally, the defines option can be used to specify preprocessor definitions that should be used when generating the documentation. These definitions are included in all targets of the compilation database. MrDocs supports multiple output formats that can be specified via the generate option: Format Description adoc AsciiDoc format. html HTML format. xml XML format. Asciidoc is a text-based format that is easy to read and write. It can also be converted to other formats such as HTML and Markdown. HTML can be generated directly with the html format. XML is a structured format that can be used in tests or as an intermediary format for other tools. The generate option can be used to specify the output format: # ... generate: adoc # ... MrDocs attempts to support various alternatives for customizing the output format and style without complex workflows to post-process XML output. For the Asciidoc and HTML generators, the desired customization can usually be achieved by modifying the templates used to generate the output. In the root of the installation directory, you will find the share/mrdocs/addons/generator directory. This directory contains the templates used to generate the documentation with the markup formats. Users can create a copy of these files and provide their own addons directory via the addons option. This allows users to customize the output format to their needs. addons: /path/to/custom/addons One advantage of custom templates over post-processing XML files is the ability to access symbols as a graph. If symbol A refers to symbol B, some properties of symbol B are likely to be required in the documentation of A. All templates and generators can access a reference to B by searching the symbol tree or simply by accessing the elements A refers to. Not all symbols in a project may be relevant to the documentation. MrDocs provides a way to filter out symbols based on their names. filters: symbols: (1) exclude: (2) include: (3) 1 Optional symbols key 2 Optional exclude key 3 Optional include key Symbol filter patterns are specified using (optionally) qualified names, and may contain wildcards: filters: symbols: exclude: - 'A::B' - 'A::f*' If a symbol matches a pattern in the exclude list, that symbol and its members will not be extracted: filters: symbols: exclude: - 'A' // ok, does not match any excluded pattern void f0(); namespace A // matches the pattern 'A', will not be extracted { // enclosing namespace matches an excluded pattern: // the symbol will not be extracted void f1(); } The filters.symbols.include key can be used to override the exclude list for specific symbols. A symbol which matches an included pattern and an excluded pattern will be extracted. This permits fine-grained control of extraction for individual members of a class or namespace: filters: symbols: exclude: - 'A' include: - 'A::g*' namespace A { // enclosing namespace matches an excluded pattern, will not be extracted void f0(); // ok, matches the pattern 'A::g*' which overrides the exclude list void g0(); } In order for a filter pattern to match a symbol, it must consist of simple identifiers that match the name as written in its declaration: namespace aliases, typedef-names, and decltype specifiers naming the symbol cannot be used. Specifying include patterns is only useful when the pattern would match a subset of symbols matched by an exclude pattern. An include pattern without a subsuming exclude pattern will be ignored. Symbols can also be filtered based on the files they are declared in. This can be useful for excluding files that exclusively contain implementation details or test code. input: include: - ../include (1) file-patterns: - *.hpp (2) 1 A list of directories to include. Only symbols defined in these files will be extracted. 2 A list of file patterns to include. Only symbols defined in files matching these patterns will be extracted. The implementation-detail and see-below options can be used to designate namespaces as implementation detail namespaces. implementation-detail: 'impl' see-below: 'see_below' If a namespace is designated as an implementation detail namespace, all symbols within that namespace will be marked as implementation details in the documentation. namespace impl { class A {}; } /// @brief A foo function A foo(); The impl namespace is designated as an implementation detail namespace, so all symbols within it will be marked as implementation details in the documentation. This means the symbol A would not be documented and the function foo could be documented as follows: /* implementation detail */ foo(); On the other hand, if a namespace is designated as a see_below namespace, all symbols within that namespace will be marked as \"see below\" in the documentation. namespace see_below { class B {}; } In the documentation, the symbol B would be marked as \"see-below\" and could be documented as: class B { /* see below */ }; The following options can be defined both in the configuration file and on the command line, where the command line options always take precedence. Options that can only be provided via the command line The following options can be used to control the general behavior of MrDocs and can only be provided via the command line. These include options to specify inputs and the configuration file, which cannot be set on the configuration file itself. Name Description Default inputs (list of paths) (Command line only) Configuration or compilation database files [] config (file path) (Required, Command line only) MrDocs configuration file \"/mrdocs.yml\" inputs Configuration or compilation database files The inputs are configuration files or compilation database files that are used to generate the documentation. These inputs can be configuration files or compilation database files. When the input ends with mrdocs.yml, it is interpreted as a configuration file, the file is read and the options are used to generate the documentation as if it was provided to the config option. When the input ends with compilation_database.json or CMakeLists.txt, it is interpreted as a compilation database file, the file is read and the compiler flags are used to generate the documentation as if it was provided to the compilation-database option. Type: list of paths Command line only Default value: [] This command is a command line sink. Any command line argument that is not recognized by the parser will be passed to this command. config MrDocs configuration file The configuration file is a YAML file that contains the options used to generate the documentation. The configuration file is read and the options are used to generate the documentation. The configuration file can be used to specify the source code, the output directory, the compilation database, the generator, and the filters. Type: file path Required Command line only Default value: \"/mrdocs.yml\" Relative paths are relative to: \"\" Paths to the source code and output directories Name Description Default source-root (directory path) Path to the root directory of the source code \"\" output (path) Directory or file for generating output \"/reference-output\" compilation-database (file path) Path to the compilation database source-root Path to the root directory of the source code Type: directory path Default value: \"\" Relative paths are relative to: \"\" output Directory or file for generating output Multipage generators expect a directory. Single page generators expect a file or a directory where the file will be created. If the directory does not exist, it will be created. Type: path Default value: \"/reference-output\" Relative paths are relative to: \"\" compilation-database Path to the compilation database Path to the compilation database or a build script to generate it. The compilation database is a JSON file that contains the compiler commands used to build the source code. The compilation database is used to extract the compiler flags and the source files used to build the source code and extract symbols. This option also accepts the path to a build script such as CMakeLists.txt to be used to generate the compilation database. In this case, MrDocs will look for CMake in PATH or in CMAKE_ROOT and run the script to generate the compilation database file. Type: file path Default value: Relative paths are relative to: \"\" Options for building the source code When MrDocs is responsible to running the build scripts and generating the compilation database, these options are used to build the source code. Name Description Default cmake (string) CMake arguments when generating the compilation database from CMakeLists.txt defines (list of strings) Additional defines passed to the compiler [] use-system-stdlib (boolean) Use the system standard library false stdlib-includes (list of paths) Standard Library include paths [\"/share/mrdocs/libcxx\", \"/share/mrdocs/clang\"] system-includes (list of paths) System include paths [] includes (list of paths) Include paths [] cmake CMake arguments when generating the compilation database from CMakeLists.txt When the compilation-database option is a CMakeLists.txt file, these arguments are passed to the cmake command to generate the compilation_database.json.

It is intended to provide an overview of the codebase and the process of adding new features. The MrDocs codebase is divided into several modules: graph TD CL[Command Line Arguments] --> P CF[Configuration File] --> P P[Options] --> E P --> CD P --> G CD[Compilation Database] --> E E[Extract Symbols] -->|Corpus| G G[Generator] --> D(Documentation) This section provides an overview of each module and how they interact with each other in the MrDocs codebase. MrDocs options affect the behavior of the compilation database, how symbols are extracted, and how the documentation is generated. They are parsed from the command line and configuration file. The main entry point of MrDocs is the DoGenerateAction function in src/tool/GenerateAction.cpp. It loads the options, creates the compilation database, and runs the extraction and generation steps. The options formed from a combination of command line arguments and configuration file settings. Command line and common options are defined in src/tool/ToolArgs.hpp. The ToolArgs class uses the llvm::cl library to define and parse the command line arguments. Common options are defined in mrdocs/Config.hpp. The Config class represents all public options that could be defined in a configuration file. It also provides a representation plugins can use to access public options from the command line or configuration file. The function clang::mrdocs::loadConfig is also provided to parse all public options from a YAML configuration file. Internally, MrDocs uses the derived clang::mrdocs::ConfigImpl class (src/lib/Lib/ConfigImpl.hpp) to also store the private representation of parsed options, such as filters. Common options are stored in the Config class, while the ToolArgs class stores common options and the command line options. For instance, the config option can only be set from the command line, as it would be illogical to expect the location of the configuration file to be defined in the configuration file itself. On the other hand, the output option can be set from both the command line and the configuration file so that the user can define a default output location in the configuration file. Thus, after the command line and configuration file options are parsed, they are finalized in the DoGenerateAction function by calling ToolArgs::apply, which overrides the configuration file options in Config with the command line options, when applicable. As a last step, DoGenerateAction converts the public Config settings into a ConfigImpl object, which is used by the rest of the program with the parsed options. At this stage, the clang frontend is used to parse the source code and generate an AST. The AST information is extracted and stored in a Corpus object (mrdocs/Corpus.hpp). The second step in DoGenerateAction is to create a CompilationDatabase object, so we can extract symbols from its source files. There are multiple possible sources for this file according to the configuration options: the file might be read directly from the path specified in the options, or it might be generated by MrDocs from build scripts. Whatever the source, a derived MrDocsCompilationDatabase object (lib/Lib/MrDocsCompilationDatabase.hpp) is created to represent the compilation database. The difference between the original CompilationDatabase and the MrDocsCompilationDatabase is that the latter includes a number of pre-processing steps to filter and transform compilation commands. For each compilation command: Command line arguments are adjusted Warnings are supressed Additional defines are added Implicit include directories are added Unrecognized arguments are removed Paths are normalized Non C++ files are filtered MrDocs represents each C++ symbol or construct as an Info node (mrdocs/Metadata/Info.hpp). MrDocs currently defines the following Info nodes: Name Description Declaration NamespaceInfo The symbol is a namespace mrdocs/Metadata/Namespace.hpp RecordInfo The symbol is a record (class or struct) mrdocs/Metadata/Record.hpp FunctionInfo The symbol is a function mrdocs/Metadata/Function.hpp EnumInfo The symbol is an enum mrdocs/Metadata/Enum.hpp TypedefInfo The symbol is a typedef mrdocs/Metadata/Typedef.hpp VariableInfo The symbol is a variable mrdocs/Metadata/Variable.hpp FieldInfo The symbol is a field mrdocs/Metadata/Field.hpp SpecializationInfo The symbol is a template specialization mrdocs/Metadata/Specialization.hpp FriendInfo The symbol is a friend declaration mrdocs/Metadata/Friend.hpp EnumeratorInfo The symbol is an enumerator mrdocs/Metadata/Enumerator.hpp GuideInfo The symbol is a deduction guide mrdocs/Metadata/Guide.hpp AliasInfo The symbol is a namespace alias mrdocs/Metadata/Alias.hpp UsingInfo The symbol is a using declaration mrdocs/Metadata/Using.hpp ConceptInfo The symbol is a concept mrdocs/Metadata/Concept.hpp Info can not only represent direct AST symbols but also C++ constructs that need to be inferred from these symbols. Nodes in the first category will typically be created in the initial extraction step, and nodes in the second category will be created in the finalization step. When defining a new Info type, it is important to consider how this type will be supported in all other modules of the codebase, including the AST visitor, generators, tests, and the documentation. The script .github/check_info_nodes_support.sh will attempt to infer whether most of these features have been implemented for each node type. MrDocs uses Clang to extract Info objects from the C++ AST. Clang offers two interfaces to access the C++ AST: the LibClang and LibTooling libraries. MrDocs uses the latter, as it provides full control over the AST traversal process at the cost of an unstable API. In LibTooling, once we have a Compilation Database, we can create a ClangTool object to run the Clang frontend on a set of source files. clang::tooling::ClangTool Tool(compilationDatabase, sourceFiles); newFrontendActionFactory actionFactory(); return Tool.run(actionFactory.get()); The clang::tooling::ClangTool::run method takes a clang::tooling::ToolAction object that defines how to process the AST. The action object that usually comes from a clang::tooling::FrontendActionFactory. In the example above, the SyntaxOnlyAction is used to parse the source code and generate the AST without any further processing. In MrDocs, this process happens in clang::mrdocs::CorpusImpl::build (src/lib/Lib/CorpusImpl.cpp), where we call Tool.run for each object in the database with our custom ASTAction action and ASTActionFactory factory (src/lib/AST/ASTVisitor.cpp). While ASTAction is the entry point for processing the AST, the real work is done by the ASTVisitor class. As the AST is generated, it is traversed by the ASTVisitor class. The entry point of this class is ASTVisitor::build, which recursively calls ASTVisitor::traverseDecl for the root clang::TranslationUnitDecl node of the translation unit. During the AST traversal stage, the complete AST generated by the clang frontend is walked beginning with this root TranslationUnitDecl node. Each clang node is converted into a mrdocs::Info node, which is then stored with any relevant information in a mrdocs::Corpus object. It is during this stage that USRs (universal symbol references) are generated and hashed with SHA1 to form the 160 bit SymbolID for an entity. Except for built-in types, all entities referenced in the corpus will be traversed and be assigned a SymbolID; including those from the standard library. This is necessary to generate the full interface for user-defined types. After running the AST traversal on all translation units, CorpusImpl::build contains finalization steps for the Corpus object. At this point, we process C++ constructs that are not directly represented in the AST. The first finalization step happens in CorpusImpl::build (src/lib/Lib/CorpusImpl.cpp), where the Info objects from a single translation unit are merged into a map containing the merged results from all other TUs. The merging step is necessary as there may be multiple identical definitions of the same entity. For instance, this represents the case where a function is declared at different points in the code base and might have different attributes or comments. At this step, the doc comments are also finalized. Each Info object has a pointer to its Javadoc object (mrdocs/Metadata/Javadoc.hpp), which is a representation of the documentation comments. After AST traversal and Info merging, the result is stored as a map of Info objects indexed by their respective SymbolID. A second finalization step is then performed in clang::mrdocs::finalize (src/lib/Metadata/Finalize.cpp), where any references to SymbolID objects that don’t exist are removed. This is necessary because the AST traversal will generate references to entities that should be filtered and are not present in the corpus. At this point, the Corpus object contains representations of all entities in the code base and further semantic C++ constructs that are not directly represented in the AST can be inferred. Documentation generators may traverse this structure by calling Corpus::traverse with a Corpus::Visitor derived visitor and the SymbolID of the entity to visit (e.g. the global namespace). Documentation generators are responsible for traversing the corpus and generating documentation in the desired format. The API for documentation generators is defined in mrdocs/Generator.hpp. The MrDocs codebase is organized as follows: This directory contains the public headers for the MrDocs library. include/mrdocs/—The core library headers include/mrdocs/ADT—Data Structures include/mrdocs/Dom—The Document Object Model for Abstract Trees include/mrdocs/Metadata—Info nodes and metadata classes include/mrdocs/Support—Various utility classes This directory contains the source code for the MrDocs library and private headers. src/lib/—The core library src/lib/AST/—The AST traversal code src/lib/Dom/—The Document Object Model for Abstract Trees src/lib/Gen/—Generators src/lib/Lib/—The core library classes src/lib/Metadata/—Info nodes and metadata classes src/lib/Support/—Various utility classes src/test/—The test directory src/test_suite/—The library used for testing src/tool/—The main program This directory contains shared resources for the documentation generators and utilities for developers. Its subdirectories are installed in the share directory of the installation. share/—Shared resources for the documentation generators share/cmake/—CMake modules to generate the documentation share/gdb/—GDB pretty printers share/mrdocs/—Shared resources for the documentation generators This directory contains the documentation for the MrDocs project. The documentation is written in AsciiDoc and can be built using the Antora tool. docs/—Documentation configuration files and scripts docs/modules/—The documentation asciidoc files docs/extensions—Antora extensions for the documentation This directory contains build scripts and configuration files for third-party libraries. third-party/—Third-party libraries third-party/llvm/—CMake Presets for LLVM third-party/duktape/—CMake scripts for Duktape third-party/lua/—A bundled Lua interpreter The AST visitor and metadata all use forward slashes to represent file pathnames, even on Windows. This is so the generated reference documentation does not vary based on the platform. Errors thrown by the program should always have type Exception. Objects of this type are capable of transporting an Error object. This is important for the scripting to work; exceptions are used to propagate errors from library code to scripts and back to the invoking code. For exceptional cases, these thrown exceptions should be uncaught. The tool installs an uncaught exception handler that prints a stack trace and exits the process immediately. All new features should be accompanied by tests. The mrdocs-test target is used to run the test suites. This target has its entry point in src/test/TestMain.cpp, which can take two paths: Golden testing: When input paths are provided to the test executable via the command line, the test suite will run the DoTestAction() that iterates all files in test-files comparing the input source files with the expected XML output files. Unit testing: When no input paths are provided, all unit tests will be run via unit_test_main(), defined by the our test-suite library in src/test_suite/test_suite.cpp. The fixtures for golden testing are defined in test-files/golden-tests, where files in each directory have the following format: mrdocs.yml: Basic configuration options for all files in this directory. .cpp: The input source file to extract symbols from. .xml: The expected XML output file generated with the XML generator. .bad.xml: The test output file generated when the test fails. .yml: Extra configuration options for this specific file.

When you write a function signature, or declare a class, it is at that moment when you are likely to have as much information as you will ever have about what it is supposed to do. The more time passes before you write the documentation, the less likely you are to remember all the details of what motivated the API in the first place. In other words, because best and worst engineers are naturally lazy, the temporal adjacency of the C++ declaration to the documentation improves outcomes. For this reason, having the documentation be as close as possible to the declaration is ideal. That is, the spatial adjacency of the C++ declaration to the documentation improves outcomes because it facilitates temporal adjacency. In summary, the automated extraction of reference documentation from C++ declarations containing attached documentation comments is ideal because: Temporally adjacent documentation is more comprehensive Spatially adjacent documentation requires less effort to maintain And causally connected documentation is more accurate From the perspective of engineers, however, the biggest advantage of automated documentation is that it implies a single source of truth for the API at a low cost. However, C++ codebases are notoriously difficult to document automatically because of constructs where the code needs to diverge from the intended API that represents the contract with the user. Tools like Doxygen typically require workarounds and manual intervention via preprocessor macros to get the documentation right. These workarounds are problematic because they effectively mean that there are two versions of the code: the well-formed and the ill-formed versions. This subverts the single sources of truth for the code. Mr. Docs Automatic Manual No Reference No workarounds ✅ ❌ ✅ ❌ Nice for users ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Single Source of Truth ✅ ❌ ❌ ❌ Less Work for Developers ✅ ❌ ❌ ✅ Always up-to-date ✅ ✅ ❌ ❌ By providing no reference to users, they are forced to read header files to understand the API. This is a problem because header files are not always the best source of truth for the API. Developers familiar with cppreference.com will know that the documentation there is often more informative than the header files. A common alternative is to provide a manual reference to the API. Developers duplicate the signatures, which requires extra work. This strategy tends to work well for small libraries and allows the developer to directly express the contract with the user. However, as the single source of truth is lost, it becomes unmanageable as the codebase grows. When the declaration changes, they forget to edit the docs, and the reference becomes out of date. In this case, it looks like the best solution is to automate the documentation. The causal connection between the declaration and the generated documentation improves outcomes. That’s when developers face difficulties with existing tools like Doxygen, which require workarounds and manual intervention to get the documentation right. The workarounds mean that there are two versions of the code: the well-formed and the ill-formed versions. The philosophy behind MrDocs is to provide solutions to these workarounds so that the single source of truth can be maintained with minimal effort by developers. With Mr.Docs, the documented C++ code should be the same as the code that is compiled. Once the documentation is extracted from the code, it is necessary to format it in a way that is useful to the user. This usually involves generating output files that match the content of the documentation to the user’s needs. A limitation of existing tools like Doxygen is that their output formats are not very customizable. It supports minor customization in the output style and, for custom content formats, it requires much more complex workflows, like generating XML files and writing secondary applications to process them. MrDocs attempts to support multiple output formats and customization options. In practice, MrDocs attempts to provide three levels of customization: At the first level, the user can use an existing generator and customize its templates and helper functions. The user can write a MrDocs plugin at a second level that defines a new generator. At a third level, it can use a generator for a structured file format and consume the output in a more uncomplicated secondary application or script. These multiple levels of complexity mean developers can worry only about the documentation content. In practice, developers rarely need new generators and are usually only interested in changing how an existing generator formats the output. Removing the necessity of writing and maintaining a secondary application only to customize the output via XML files can save these developers an immense amount of time. To deal with the complexity of C++ constructs, MrDocs uses clang’s libtooling API. That means MrDocs understands all C++: if clang can compile it, MrDocs knows about it.

However, documenting C++ poses significant challenges due to discrepancies between the codebase and the public API. Doxygen remains a popular tool, yet it is suboptimal for C++ as it fails to fully comprehend C++ constructs and requires many transformation steps, including the incorporation of many macros within the C++ code. These macros maintain well-formed and ill-formed versions of the code, undermining the goal of unifying the source of truth. Existing solutions frequently need better maintenance or usability issues, prompting users to revert to Doxygen. An ideal solution would inherently understand C++ constructs, be actively maintained, and offer diverse options for customizing the output format. MrDocs embodies these qualities.

Fell free to install them anywhere you want and adjust the main MrDocs configuration command later. MrDocs uses the fmt library for formatting strings. From the third-party directory, you can clone the fmt repository and install it with the following commands: git clone https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt --branch 10.2.1 --depth 1 (1) cd fmt cmake -S . -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D FMT_DOC=OFF -D FMT_TEST=OFF (2) cmake --build ./build --config Release (3) cmake --install ./build --prefix ./install (4) cd .. 1 Shallow clones the fmt repository. 2 Configure the fmt library with CMake, excluding the documentation and tests. 3 Builds the fmt library in the build directory. 4 Installs the fmt library in the install directory. All instructions in this document assume you are using a CMake version above 3.26. Binaries are available at CMake’s official website. If you prefer using Vcpkg to install dependencies, you can install VcPkg and fmt with the following commands from the third-party directory: Windows PowerShell Unix Variants git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git -b master (1) cd vcpkg bootstrap-vcpkg.bat (2) vcpkg.exe install fmt --triplet x64-windows (3) 1 Clones the Vcpkg repository. 2 Bootstraps Vcpkg. 3 Installs the fmt library. git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git -b master (1) cd vcpkg ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh (2) ./vcpkg install fmt (3) 1 Clones the Vcpkg repository. 2 Bootstraps Vcpkg. 3 Installs the fmt library. You can also install fmt with Vcpkg in Manifest mode. In manifest mode, you declare your project’s direct dependencies in a manifest file named vcpkg.json. MrDocs includes a vcpkg.json.example file you can duplicate or create a symlink as vcpkg.json to use this mode. This file includes all the dependencies MrDocs needs, except for LLVM. In this mode, VcPkg will create separate installed trees for each project and configuration. This is the recommended vcpkg mode for most users, according to the vcpkg documentation. MrDocs uses the duktape library for JavaScript parsing. From the third-party directory, you can download the duktape source code from the official release: Windows PowerShell Unix Variants Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/releases/download/v2.7.0/duktape-2.7.0.tar.xz\" -OutFile \"duktape-2.7.0.tar.xz\" (1) 1 Downloads the duktape source code. curl -LJO https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/releases/download/v2.7.0/duktape-2.7.0.tar.xz (1) 1 Downloads the duktape source code. Then patch the Duktape source code to provide CMake support. tar -xf duktape-2.7.0.tar.xz (1) cp ../mrdocs/third-party/duktape/CMakeLists.txt ./duktape-2.7.0/CMakeLists.txt (2) cp ../mrdocs/third-party/duktape/duktapeConfig.cmake.in ./duktape-2.7.0/duktapeConfig.cmake.in (3) cd duktape-2.7.0 1 Extracts the duktape source code. 2 Patches the source code with a CMakeLists.txt file to the duktape-2.7.0 directory so that we can build it with CMake. 3 Copies the duktapeConfig.cmake.in file to the duktape-2.7.0 directory so that we can install it with CMake and find it later from other CMake projects. Now adjust the duk_config.h file to indicate we are statically building Duktape. Windows PowerShell Unix Variants $content = Get-Content -Path \"src\\duk_config.h\" (1) $content = $content -replace '#define DUK_F_DLL_BUILD', '#undef DUK_F_DLL_BUILD' (2) $content | Set-Content -Path \"src\\duk_config.h\" (3) 1 Read the content of duk_config.h 2 Replace the DUK_F_DLL_BUILD macro with #undef DUK_F_DLL_BUILD 3 Write the content back to the file sed -i 's/#define DUK_F_DLL_BUILD/#undef DUK_F_DLL_BUILD/g' \"src/duk_config.h\" (1) 1 Disables the DUK_F_DLL_BUILD macro in the duk_config.h file to indicate we are statically building duktape. And finally install the library with CMake: cmake -S . -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release (1) cmake --build ./build --config Release (2) cmake --install ./build --prefix ./install (3) 1 Configures the duktape library with CMake. 2 Builds the duktape library in the build directory. 3 Installs the duktape library with CMake support in the install directory. The scripts above downloads the duktape source code, extracts it, and configures it with CMake. The CMake scripts provided by MrDocs are copied to the duktape-2.7.0 directory to facilitate the build process with CMake and provide CMake installation scripts for other projects. If you prefer using Vcpkg to install dependencies, you can install duktape with the following commands from the third-party directory: Windows PowerShell Unix Variants cd vcpkg vcpkg.exe install duktape --triplet x64-windows (1) 1 Installs the duktape library. cd vcpkg ./vcpkg install duktape (1) 1 Installs the duktape library. These examples assume VcPkg is already installed in the third-party/vcpkg directory (see the Fmt section). MrDocs uses libxml2 tools for tests. Only developers need to install this dependency. Users can skip this step. From the third-party directory, you can clone the libxml2 repository and install it with the following commands: git clone https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2 --branch v2.12.6 --depth 1 (1) cd libxml2 cmake -S . -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLIBXML2_WITH_PROGRAMS=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_FTP=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_HTTP=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_ICONV=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_LEGACY=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_LZMA=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_ZLIB=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_ICU=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_TESTS=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_HTML=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_C14N=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_CATALOG=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_DEBUG=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_ISO8859X=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_MEM_DEBUG=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_MODULES=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_OUTPUT=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_PATTERN=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_PUSH=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_PYTHON=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_READER=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_REGEXPS=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_SAX1=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_SCHEMAS=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_SCHEMATRON=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_THREADS=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_THREAD_ALLOC=OFF -DLIBXML2_WITH_TREE=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_VALID=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_WRITER=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_XINCLUDE=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_XPATH=ON -DLIBXML2_WITH_XPTR=ON (2) cmake --build ./build --config Release (3) cmake --install ./build --prefix ./install (4) cd .. 1 Shallow clones the libxml2 repository. 2 Configure the libxml2 with CMake, excluding the documentation, tests, and unwanted dependencies. 3 Builds libxml2 in the build directory. 4 Installs libxml2 in the install directory. If you prefer using Vcpkg to install dependencies, you can install libxml2 with the following commands from the third-party directory: Windows PowerShell Unix Variants cd vcpkg vcpkg.exe install libxml2[tools] --triplet x64-windows (1) 1 Installs libxml2. cd vcpkg ./vcpkg install libxml2[tools] (1) 1 Installs libxml2. These examples assume VcPkg is already installed in the third-party/vcpkg directory (see the Fmt section). MrDocs uses LLVM to parse C++ code and extract documentation from it. It depends on a recent version of LLVM: e1065370 Download: You can shallow-clone the project from the official repository. From the third-party directory, run the following commands: mkdir -p llvm-project (1) cd llvm-project git init (2) git remote add origin https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git (3) git fetch --depth 1 origin e1065370aaacb1b1cb48e77d37d376bf024f4a39 (4) git checkout FETCH_HEAD (5) 1 Create a directory for the llvm-project instead of cloning it 2 Initialize a git repository 3 Add the official LLVM repository as a remote 4 Fetch the commit we want to use: this allows us to shallow-clone the repository at this commit 5 Checkout the commit we want to use Configure: The mrdocs/third-party/llvm directory provides CMake presets to build LLVM. We recommend using preset files as they contain a replicable set of CMake configuration values that can be used for a project. From third-party/llvm-project, you can copy the CMakePresets.json and CMakeUserPresets.json files to the llvm-project/llvm directory. cp ../../mrdocs/third-party/llvm/CMakePresets.json ./llvm cp ../../mrdocs/third-party/llvm/CMakeUserPresets.json ./llvm/CMakeUserPresets.json Run a command such as the following to configure LLVM: Windows PowerShell Unix Variants cd llvm cmake -S . -B ./build --preset=release-win cd llvm cmake -S . -B ./build --preset=release-unix In the example above, we configure a Release version of LLVM for MrDocs. Choose one of the presets from CMakePresets.json or edit the variants in CMakeUserPresets.json to customize the configurations. Developers might also want to build a custom Debug LLVM configuration including optimizations, which allows for faster execution of tests. The relwithdebinfo and debwithopt presets are provided for this purpose. Or if you prefer using the command line, set CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES or CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Debug and manually include the optimization flags to -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"/O2 /Zi\" (MSVC) or -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-Og -g\". This should give you an optimized build with all debug features and flags, such as an appropriate _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL and the /MDd flag in MSVC. In other platforms, this should give you a release somewhat equivalent to RelWithDebInfo optimized for debugging experience. -Og offers a reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation and a good debugging experience. Build: Build and install the configured version of LLVM with: cmake --build ./build --config Release --parallel 4 cmake --install ./build --prefix ../install Replace 4 with the number of cores you want to use for building LLVM. Return from ./third-party/llvm-project/llvm to the LLVM project directory: cd ../.. In addition to LLVM, MrDocs requires a deterministic version of the C standard library (LibC) to ensure consistent behavior across various environments. This step is crucial for replicating specific compiler and library configurations. Download: Continue using the same LLVM project directory. Configure: Configure and build LibC++ using the existing structure: export CXX=\"./install/bin/clang++\" export CC=\"./install/bin/clang\" Run a command such as the following to configure LLVM: Windows PowerShell Unix Variants cmake -G Ninja \\ -S runtimes \\ -B build-libcxx \\ -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES=\"libcxx;libcxxabi\" \\ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\"$(pwd)/install\" \\ -DLIBCXXABI_USE_LLVM_UNWINDER=OFF \\ -DLIBCXXABI_ENABLE_SHARED=OFF \\ -DLIBCXXABI_ENABLE_STATIC=ON \\ -DLIBCXX_ENABLE_SHARED=OFF \\ -DLIBCXX_NO_VCRUNTIME=ON \\ -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-D__ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__=1234 -D__ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN__=4321 -D__BYTE_ORDER__=__ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__\" cmake -G Ninja \\ -S runtimes \\ -B build-libcxx \\ -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES=\"libcxx;libcxxabi;libunwind\" \\ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\"$(pwd)/install\" Build: Build and install the configured version of LibC++ with: Windows PowerShell Unix Variants ninja -C build-libcxx cxx ninja -C build-libcxx install-cxx ninja -C build-libcxx cxx cxxabi unwind ninja -C build-libcxx install-cxx install-cxxabi install-unwind Return from ./third-party/llvm-project to the parent directory to build and install MrDocs: cd ../.. Return from ./third-party/vcpkg to the parent directory of third-party (the one containing the mrdocs directory) to build and install MrDocs: cd ../.. Configure: You can also configure MrDocs with command line arguments or CMake presets. Configure with Command Line Arguments: With the dependencies are available in third-party, you can configure MrDocs with: Windows PowerShell Unix Variants cmake -S mrdocs -B build -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A x64 -D CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES=\"RelWithDebInfo\" -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -D LLVM_ROOT=\"%cd%/third-party/llvm+clang/RelWithDebInfo\" -D DUKTAPE_SOURCE_ROOT=\"%cd%/third-party/duktape-2.7.0\" -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=\"%cd%/third-party/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake\" cmake -S mrdocs -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -D LLVM_ROOT=\"$(pwd)/third-party/llvm+clang/RelWithDebInfo\" -D DUKTAPE_SOURCE_ROOT=\"$(pwd)/third-party/duktape-2.7.0\" -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=\"$(pwd)/third-party/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake\" Configure with CMake Presets: The MrDocs repository also includes a CMakePresets.json file that contains the parameters to configure MrDocs with CMake. To specify the installation directories, you can use the LLVM_ROOT, DUKTAPE_SOURCE_ROOT, CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE environment variables. To specify a generator (-G) and platform name (-A), you can use the CMAKE_GENERATOR and CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM environment variables. You can also customize the presets by duplicating and editing the CMakeUserPresets.json.example file in the mrdocs directory. This is typically more convenient than using environment variables. Build: Then build and install MrDocs with: cd build cmake --build . cmake --install . To customize the installation directory, use the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option or use the --prefix option for the cmake --install . command. To customize the C and C++ compilers, use the CMAKE_C_COMPILER and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER options. Developers should also enable -D BUILD_TESTING=ON. If any custom build of LLVM other than RelWithDebInfo is being used, the LLVM_ROOT variable should be set to the installation directory of that build. The MrDocs installation directory follows the \"Filesystem Hierarchy Standard\" (FHS) layout: bin: the MrDocs executable intended to be used by users or invoked from the command line. share: resource files installed by MrDocs doc: the MrDocs documentation include: the MrDocs headers lib: the MrDocs library The FHS layout provides a directory structure that also serves as a widely accepted convention for organizing files and directories in Unix-like systems, but that can be used in any operating system.

Edit this Page","title":"License","component":"mrdocs","version":"develop","name":"license","url":"/mrdocs/develop/license.html","titles":[]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"Getting Started arrow_back arrow_forward The mrdocs.yml configuration file contains information about the project. If you’re used to Doxygen, this file is similar to the Doxyfile configuration file. Here is an example of a mrdocs.yml file: source-root: ../include multipage: false generate: adoc In many projects, it is common to have the documentation in a docs directory, which can also contain this configuration file. + + docs + mrdocs.yml + ... + include + src + test + ... The most important information is the source-root option, which determines the root of the source tree relative to the mrdocs.yml file. The list of all available options can be found in the The Configuration File page. For consistency, these instructions assume you have the mrdocs executable in PATH. You can invoke MrDocs from the command line with the following command: mrdocs path/to/mrdocs.yml If you are at the path of the mrdocs.yml file, you can simply run: mrdocs You can also specify other commands to MrDocs directly from the command line to set or override options from the mrdocs.yml file (See all options in The Configuration File page). mrdocs path/to/mrdocs.yml --output=../docs/reference Except for the path to the mrdocs.yml file, all other relative paths are made absolute relative to the mrdocs.yml file. One way to simplify the documentation generation process is by using a compile_commands.json file generated by CMake to determine the source files to process and their compile options. This file is generated by the CMake configuration step when the CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS option is set to ON. cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON At this step, you can also add any other flags you want to pass to cmake, such as -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release or -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++. If you are using the Visual Studio generator, you might need to switch to the Ninja generator to generate the compile_commands.json file. This will generate a compile_commands.json file in the build directory containing all commands needed to compile your project. This file can be used by MrDocs to determine the source files to process and their compile options. mrdocs --compilation-database=../build/compile_commands.json --output=../docs/reference MrDocs will go through all the source files listed in the compile_commands.json file and generate the documentation for them. When MrDocs goes through the commands in the compilation database, it will go through the same targets as the compiler. Only symbols present in these targets will be documented. In the case of header-only libraries, the symbols will be documented only if they are included in one of these targets. It’s common to have different configurations for the documentation generation than for the project build. This means CMake is often being run just to generate a custom compile_commands.json for the documentation. Also, the compile_commands.json file is a configuration artifact, which means it often lacks a stable location that can be referenced in the mrdocs.yml configuration file. Thus, the pattern of using a compile_commands.json file generated by CMake is so common that MrDocs provides a CMake module to simplify the process. You can let MrDocs generate the compile_commands.json file for you by providing the path to the CMakeLists.txt file of your project. mrdocs --compilation-database=../CMakeLists.txt --output=../docs/reference By providing your CMakeLists.txt file as the reference for you compilation database, MrDocs will automatically run CMake to generate the compile_commands.json file in a temporary directory. Not only this simplifies the usage but also ensures that the stable compilation database file can be used in the mrdocs.yml configuration file. MrDocs does not bundle CMake. If you want to use this feature, you need to have CMake installed on your system and available in PATH. Parameters for cmake, such as -D BUILDING_TEST=OFF -D MRDOCS_BUILD=ON can also be specified with the cmake option in configuration file. MrDocs will always append the CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON flag to the cmake command. In many projects, a common pattern is to define a special build configuration for the documentation generation such that: Tests, examples, and auxiliary targets excluded All header-only files are included in targets Unnecessary sources files are excluded from targets This can usually be achieved by defining a custom target in the CMakeLists.txt with a single source file that includes all the necessary header files. if (MY_PROJECT_MRDOCS_BUILD) # Glob all header files set(INCLUDE_DIR \"${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include\") file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADER_FILES \"${INCLUDE_DIR}/*.hpp\") # Create a temporary source file that includes all header files set(TEMP_CPP_FILE \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/all_headers.cpp\") file(WRITE ${OUTPUT_FILE} \"// This file is generated automatically by CMake\\n\\n\") foreach(HEADER_FILE ${HEADER_FILES_LIST}) file(APPEND ${OUTPUT_FILE} \"#include \\\"${HEADER_FILE}\\\"\\n\") endforeach() # Create a custom target for MrDocs add_library(my_project_mrdocs_target ${TEMP_CPP_FILE}) # Set any other target properties here target_include_directories(my_project_mrdocs_target PRIVATE ${INCLUDE_DIR}) target_link_libraries(my_project_mrdocs_target PRIVATE an_external_library) # Don't create any other targets return() endif() To use this target, you can run CMake with the MY_PROJECT_MRDOCS_BUILD flag set to ON: mrdocs --cmake=\"-D MY_PROJECT_MRDOCS_BUILD=ON\" --compilation-database=../CMakeLists.txt --output=..\\docs\\reference Because these paths and options are stable, you can specify them in the mrdocs.yml configuration file. cmake: \"-D MY_PROJECT_MRDOCS_BUILD=ON\" compilation-database: ../CMakeLists.txt output: ../docs/reference Unlike other documentation generators, MrDocs only works with valid C++ code. Instead of partially preprocessing the source files and inferring symbols from potentially ill-formed code, MrDocs relies on the compilation database and Clang to preprocess the source files. Thus, for each common C++ construct, MrDocs provides commands or options to identify and extract the relevant information as intended by the user. For instance, a common ill-formed Doxygen pattern to specify a class as an implementation detail is: #ifdef DOCS __implementation_defined__ #else impl::f_return_t #endif f(); In this pattern, the user wants to document the function f as implementation_defined f(); because the library contract is that the user should not rely on a specific return type here. However, this ill-formed pattern is problematic: implementation_defined is not a valid symbol so the code is ill-formed impl::f_return_t doesn’t express the intent of the user for the documentation the developer has to effectively maintain two versions of the code the original source code becomes more and more unreadable Instead, when using MrDocs, the same function could be documented as: impl::f_return_t f(); And the user can specify that impl as a namespace for implementation details in the configuration file: # ... implementation-detail: impl # ... The Commands and The Configuration File pages contain a list of all available commands and options to identify and extract the relevant information as intended by the user. MrDocs provides multiple mechanisms are provided to specify special C++ patterns, such as the example above. For each common C++ construct that would require macros and two versions of the code, MrDocs provides commands to identify the construct and extract the relevant information as intented by the user.
